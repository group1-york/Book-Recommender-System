# Book-Recommender-System
Book Recommender
The goal of this project is to build a book recommending application. The success of the project will be determined by the accuracy with which the system recommends appropriate books to readers (RMSE and TPR). The model can be reused by libraries, booksellers, social networks, book clubs, etc.

## Introduction and Discussion
A taste in books is a very subjective matter; therefore, the model should not recommend the books with highest absolute popularity, but the books that are most likely to appeal to a particular reader.  
The dataset used in this book recommendation model includes just over a million ratings recorded over several years by the Bookcrossing community. User-based collaborative filtering method on a rating matrix is applied to study the relationship between users and ratings, as well as between books  and ratings, and the results are used to predict what books a new reader (book club member, etc.) will like. RMSE is used to measure the accuracy of the  recommendation model.
